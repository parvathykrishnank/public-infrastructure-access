## Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform - Public Infrastructure Access (PIA) Tools
Welcome to the GPBP-PIA Project Repository, which hosts all analysis notebooks and platform code for developing and supporting Public Infrastructure Access tools. Due to space constraints, all datasets are hosted externally and can be accessed via the link provided below. This repository is designed to be open-source, scalable, and replicable across multiple countries, focusing on data-driven decision-making for public investment and asset management. The PIA project on pim-pam.net is part of the Geospatial Planning and Budgeting Platform (GPBP), designed to enhance Public Investment Management (PIM) and Public Asset Management (PAM). It leverages geospatial data and optimization models to provide decision-support tools for governments, development partners, and stakeholders.

By integrating global and local datasets, the platform enables:
- **Accessibility Analysis:** Evaluate and improve access to essential public services like healthcare and education.
- **Infrastructure Optimization:** Suggest optimal locations for new facilities based on population needs, climate risks, and cost-benefit analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Provide user-friendly, map-based insights for evidence-based decision-making.

Developed with scalability and replicability, PIA uses open-source tools, cloud-based architecture, and cutting-edge analytics to support sustainable development goals (SDGs) and climate resilience.

### Repository Overview

This repository contains:
- Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, optimization modeling, and visualization.
- Platform Code: Backend, frontend, and deployment scripts for the PIA web application.
- Documentation: Technical specifications, user guides, and developer resources.
- Tests: Unit and integration tests to ensure platform reliability.

**Access to Data**
All datasets required for analysis and platform development are hosted on Google Drive. Please access the data through the link below:
